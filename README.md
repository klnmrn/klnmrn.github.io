I used one of the free HTML5 UP templates, but with a few modifications on the project page in order to showcase better my work. I hope you'll like it!

This is Dimension, a fun little one-pager with modal-ized (is that a word?) "pages"
and a cool depth effect (click on a menu item to see what I mean). Simple, fully
responsive, and kitted out with all the usual pre-styled elements you'd expect.
Hope you dig it :)
